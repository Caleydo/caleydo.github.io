In Caleydo Web, all components are [plugins](../plugin_mechanism). The client is realized in TypeScript and JavaScript using HTML5, while the server is implemented in Python and uses the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. Client and server communicate via REST and Websocket interfaces. 

This documentation has two components: [Tutorials](../tutorial), where we demonstrate how to build increasingly complex applications using a mix of all components, and the Reference (todo), where we explain the core components in detail.
