The container repository includes a shell script file *manage.sh*, which helps installing and managing Caleydo Web plugins and their dependencies in the virtual environment. It uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) for resolving web dependencies and [Python pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) for python dependencies. [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) is used for building Caleydo Web and running the web server.

## TODO

* How does it work?
* Which repos are involved?
* What CI software is being used?
