To create an application, add a new folder to the plugin directory that follows this structure:

* `index.html` standard HTML
* `main.js` this is where your custom JavasSript goes
* `data` put data in this directory, 
* `index.json` defines the data format in JSON
* `style.scss` contains your Sass styles
