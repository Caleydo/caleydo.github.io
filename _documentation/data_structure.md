Caleydo Web supports simple loading and handling of various data. It provides data structures for lazy loading and accessing data using promises (TODO). These data structures are implemented in the [core plugin](https://github.com/Caleydo/caleydo_core).

## Loading Datasets

The way data is accessed in Caleydo Web can vary. For example, data could be loaded from a .csv file or retrieved from an SQL database. In the end, it up to different [plugins](../plugin_mechanism) and concrete implementations of data structure interfaces how the data is accessed.

### Dataset Parsing

Tabular datasets in a form of .csv files can be loaded by providing the dataset file itself and a definition of the dataset. The definition is provided in an `index.json` file and could look like this:

{% highlight json %}

[
  {
    "id": "anscombe_II",
    "name": "Anscombe II",
    "path": "anscombe_II.csv",
    "type": "matrix",
    "size": [12, 2],
    "rowtype": "row",
    "coltype": "dimension",
    "separator": ";",
    "value": {
      "type": "real",
      "range": [0, 12]
    }
  }
]

{% endhighlight %}

The following properties are common to all supported dataset types:

* `id` A string specifying a dataset id.
* `name` A string specifying the name of the dataset.
* `path` The path to the data file.
* `type` The dataset type. Currently `matrix`, `table`, `vector`, and `stratification` are supported.
* `size` The size of the dataset. In case of a matrix, number of rows and columns.
* `separator`: String that is used as separator in the data file. Default: ",".

An `index.json` file may contain definitions for multiple datasets. For more definition examples have a look at our [caleydo_sample_app](https://github.com/Caleydo/caleydo_sample_app).

### Dataset Access

There are two basic ways to access the data files from the client code. The first way is the **get** method specified in `caleydo_core/data`. It takes the dataset id specified in the dataset defininition as parameter and returns a promise for an associated data structure object (Matrix, Table, Vector, Stratification). Note that this method involves code from the server side of Caleydo Web and thus will not work with the lightweight client library version.

The second way is the **parseRemoteMatrix** method specified in `caleydo_d3/parser`. It takes the dataset file path as argument and returns a promise for an associated data structure object. In this case, the `index.json` file must be located in the same directory as the dataset file. This method will also work for the client library version of Caleydo Web.

Another way to access datasets is to use the **list** method from `caleydo_core/data`. This method looks for dataset definitions in all Caleydo Web plugins. All found datasets are accessible via a promise to an array of datastructure objects. This method will not work in the client library version.

## Data Structures

All data structures are part of the [core plugin](https://github.com/Caleydo/caleydo_core). Currently, the following data structures are supported: *Matrix*, *Table*, *Vector*, *Stratification*. 

### Matrix

We consider a matrix as a two-dimensional data structure with rows and columns. Both rows and columns specify ids for different entities, for example, the rows are patients and the columns are genes. As a result, all values in the matrix have the same meaning, such as "gene expression".

|         | Gene 1           | Gene 2  |  Gene 3 |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|:-----:|
| **Patient 1**     | 5.4 | 4.1 | 8.3 |
| **Patient 2**     | 0.8      |   2.0 |0.0 |
| **Patient 3** | 3.2   |    7.7 |10.0 |  

#### Data File Definition

The definition for a matrix datafile could look like this:

{% highlight json %}
[
  {
    "name": "Expression Data",
    "id": "expression_data",
    "path": "expression.csv",
    "type": "matrix",
    "size": [3, 3],
    "rowtype": "patient",
    "coltype": "gene",
    "separator": ";",
    "value": {
      "type": "real",
      "range": [0, 10]
    }
  }
]

{% endhighlight %}

Consider the following properties for a matrix definition:

* `rowtype` Id type for the rows.
* `coltype` Id type for the columns.
* `value` Description of the values in the matrix. The `type` property specifies the data type. Valid values `real`, `int`, `categorical`, and `string`. `range` specifies minimum and maximum values for numerical data types.

#### Usage

Caleydo Web matrices implement the [IMatrix](http://data.caleydo.org/builds/lib/docs/interfaces/_caleydo_core_matrix_.imatrix.html) interface, which can be extended to provide custom matrix implementations. Important attributes include:

* `rowtype` IDType (todo) for the matrix rows.
* `coltype` IDType (todo) for the matrix columns.
* `valuetype` Description of the values in the matrix, i.e., type, range etc. as specified in the definition file.
* `t` Transposed version of the matrix.

Methods to access the data make use of range (todo) parameters to specify a subset on the data. If no parameter is provided, the maximum range, i.e., all data is considered. Most methods also return promises (todo) instead of directly returning resulting values. Here are some important methods of a matrix:

* `data(range)` Returns a promise to the data of the matrix. If a 1D range is provided instead of a 2D range, only the rows are subsetted and all columns are returned.
* `rows(range)` Returns a promise to the row names of the matrix.
* `rowIds(range)` Returns a promise to the row ids specified as range.
* `cols(range)` Returns a promise to the column names of the matrix.
* `colIds(range)` Returns a promise to the column ids specified as range.
* `view(range)` Returns a view on the matrix, which can be used like a matrix object, but only consists of the subset specified by the range parameter.

Example: 

{% highlight javascript %}

parser.parseRemoteMatrix('./data/anscombe_2.csv').then(function (matrix) {

  var v = matrix.view(ranges.parse("0:5", "0:-1"));

  Promise.all([v.data(), v.rows()]).then(function (promise) {

    console.log("Matrix data: " + promise[0].toString());
    console.log("Row names: " + promise[1].toString());
  }
});

{% endhighlight %}



### Table

Like the matrix, a table is a two dimensional data structure with rows and columns. In contrast to the matrix, only the rows specify entities using ids, whereas the columns represent different attributes of an entity. For example, if rows represent patients, the columns could represent attributes like gender or age.

| Patient        | Gender        | Age  |  Value |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|:-----:|
| Patient 1     | male | 20 | 0.3 |
| Patient 2     | female      |   55 |0.1 |
| Patient 3 | male   |    32 |1.0 |

#### Data File Definition

This is how the definition of a table file could look like:

{% highlight json %}
  {
    "name": "Test Heterogeneous 10x4",
    "path": "test_h10x4.csv",
    "id": "test_h10x4"
    "size": [10, 4],
    "type": "table",
    "idtype": "patient",
    "columns": [
    {
      "name": "Gender",
      "value": {
        "type": "categorical",
        "categories": [
          {
            "name": "male",
            "color": "blue"
          },
          {
            "name": "female",
            "color": "red"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Age",
      "value": {
        "type": "int",
        "range": [0, 100]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Value",
      "value": {
        "type": "real",
        "range": [0, 1]
      }
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}


Have a look at the following properties of a table definition:

* `idtype` Specifies the id type of the rows.
* `columns` As all columns refer to different attributes, their meaning has to be specified. The `name` property refers to the column name. The `value` property is to be interpreted the same way as for matrices, but here one it only valid for the corresponding column instead of the whole dataset.

#### Usage

Tables in Caleydo Web are implementations of the [ITable](http://caleydo.gehlenborg.com/builds/lib/docs/interfaces/_caleydo_core_table_.itable.html) interface. An attribute worth mentioning is the `rowtype`, which specifies the id type of the rows. Many methods of the table such as `data(range)`Â´, `rows(range)`, or `view(range)` work similar to the matrix methods, using ranges as parameters and promises for return values. The main difference is how columns are handled: `cols(range)` returns a promise to an array of [vector](#vector) objects, one vector for each column. Here is a usage example:

{% highlight javascript %}

data.get('test_h10x4').then(function (table) {

  Promise.all([table.data(), table.cols()).then(function (promise) {

    console.log("All table data: " + promise[0].toString());
    var firstColumnVector = promise[1][0];
    
    firstColumnVector.data().then(function(vectorData){
      console.log("Data of first Column: " + promise[0].toString());
    });
});

{% endhighlight %}

### Vector

A vector is a data structure that associates an id with a single attribute value. Thus, a vector can be thought of one column of a [table](#table), or as a table with a single attribute column.


| ID        | Value        |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
| Patient 1     | 0.3 |
| Patient 2     | 1.0      | 
| Patient 3 | 0.8   |
| Patient 4 | 0.4   |
| Patient 5 | 0.6   |

#### Data File Definition

This is how the definition of a vector looks like when it is loaded from a file:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "Patient Vector",
  "path": "vector.csv",
  "size": 10,
  "type": "vector",
  "idtype": "patient",
  "value": {
    "type": "real",
    "range": [0, 1]
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, the `idtype` refers to the id type of the columns, whereas the `value` describes the values of the vector, just like in the matrix definition or the definition of table columns.

#### Usage

Vectors implement the [IVector](http://data.caleydo.org/builds/lib/docs/interfaces/_caleydo_core_vector_.ivector.html) interface.

### Stratification

| ID        | Group        |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
| Patient 1     | one |
| Patient 2     | two      | 
| Patient 3 | one   |
| Patient 4 | two   |
| Patient 5 | two   |

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "D2 Column KMeans 3",
  "origin": "demo_app/D2",
  "path": "d2t.3.csv",
  "separator": "\t",
  "type": "stratification",
  "idtype": "patient",
  "size": 5,

  "ngroups": 3,
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "one",
      "size": 2
    },
    {
      "name": "two",
      "size": 3
    }
  ],
  
  "ws": "random"
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Usage

Stratifications implement the [IStratification](http://data.caleydo.org/builds/lib/docs/interfaces/_caleydo_core_stratification_.istratification.html) interface.

Datatypes
---------
Datatypes are just a specific plugin type implementing a minimal interface `datatypes.IDataType`

basic principles: 
 * *metadata* 

   the description contains the most important meta data (types, dimensions, value types, ranges,...)

 * *subsetting/views* 

   subsetting a matrix/vector results in another matrix/vector. e.g. a taking just the first half of vector is just another vector, the visualization doesn't have to even know that. A subset is just a special view on the raw data no data is copied unless needed

 * *ids and annotations*

   every annotation (e.g. gene symbol EGFR) is assigned a unique integer id on the sever side (e.g. 5). ids are used for selection since they are more efficient to handle than strings. Actually the ids of a dataset are accessible as a multi-dimensional `range`. 

 * *selection work in the dataset domain* 
   a visualization just selects data within its dataset. e.g. the first row/column is selected nothing more. Similarly the (global) selections are converted to the dataset domain. e.g. the vis will be notified that rows 1 to 3 are selected. Internally the row indices are converted to their corresponding unique id numbers and these are selected within the idtype. 

server side principles

 * datastores

   datastores are plugins that support different types of storage. current ones https://github.com/Caleydo/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=caleydo_data + a default one for [CSV files](https://github.com/Caleydo/caleydo_server/blob/master/dataset_csv.py). A datastore is a unified way to list, upload, delete, and modify a datsets. 

 * numpy
   
   matrixes and vectors are accessible as numpy arrays. ranges support conversions to numpy selectors

 * TODO: filter, selection, query



vis.ts
------

visualization `vis.IVisIntance`, factory pattern: `create(data: datatypes.IDataType, parent: DOMElement, options)`
