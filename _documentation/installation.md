To develop Caleydo Web applications, you can use a container repository that includes a Vagrant VM.
It is used for creating, combining, and managing individual plugins Caleydo Web consists of.

Creating, managing and enforcing a unified development environment is challenging. Individual tools, such as python virtual environments provide ways to do that. However, creating a unified heterogeneous environment with external dependencies and tools (databases, multiple languages, ...) remains difficult. [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) provides a central management by isolating the dev environment into a virtual machine. This allows that all members use a similar environment and also reduces the tackles handling different operating systems, versions, ... 

Caleydo Web is a collection of individual plugins. The Caleydo Web Container project acts as a management and unified container for the collection. This repository contains just of management utilities along with the Vagrantfile for creating the virtual machine.
