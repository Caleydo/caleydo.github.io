Genoptikum is an interactive data exploration system for the visualization of and navigation in molecular and clinical data in the field of personalized medicine. Genoptikum addresses the essential but to date unsolved problem of how to identify connections between genetic variants and their corresponding diseases or the response to certain drugs and treatments, respectively. It is, therefore, necessary to connect gene data and clinical data in order to categorise specific subgroups of patients with certain disease features. The huge amount of data provided by molecular analytical methods (genetic polymorphisms, gene expression data, proteomics) can only be analysed by applying statistical methods and bioinformatics. However, even standard methods of statistics and bioinformatics fail when the data are inhomogeneous as is the case with clinical data and when data structures are obscured by noise and dominant patterns. Genoptikum should make the structure of the data spaces visible by using innovative methods of visualisation based on multiple high resolution displays in combination with data projection technologies. Genoptikum is bases on fundamental results in the fields of visualisation of information and multimodal user interfaces which enable an interactive navigation and structuring of both molecular and clinical data. Through a close link between several input channels, which are simultaneously active, and by immediate visualisation of the steps of the analysis, the expert is provides with a tool for the interactive exploration of complex data spaces. As input parameter for analysis algorithms Genoptikum makes use of the human visual capacity to grasp complex patterns to reveal hidden structures and correlations in large data spaces.
