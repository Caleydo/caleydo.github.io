Understanding large and heterogeneous data is a central requirement in modern drug development. In this project we propose a pathway-centric approach to visualize large and diverse datasets that are relevant to the early drug development process. In a user-centered, rapid prototyping approach we will develop novel methods and software to address pressing analysis problems faced by researchers in pharmacology and molecular biology. In this context we target two specific aims:

Visualizing structure-activity relationships of compounds in the context of pathways and phenotypic assays}, which will allow researchers to understand the interactions between large numbers of compounds and binding partners within pathways as well as their effect on the phenotypes.

Visualizing the effects compounds have on cell lines in context of biomolecular data and pathways}, which will enable researchers to identify compounds that are effective for certain cell lines and disease (e.g., cancer) subtypes.
  
When we address each of these aims we will not only produce a functional prototype available to the life science community but we will also improve on the state of the art in computer science research on how to visualize large graphs with many and heterogeneous node attributes (the various datasets mapped to the pathways). We will work closely with a user group of researchers that require solutions to these analysis problems for their work. The software will be developed based on and in the framework of the Caleydo project, which is a mature, open-source visual analysis solution for the life sciences.
