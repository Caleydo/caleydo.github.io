<p>
  I'm a PhD student and project assistant in the Visual Data Science Group of the <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>, Austria.
  My research focuses on interactive visualizations in the data visualization field. Together with my colleagues, I design and build data analysis tools to support domain experts.
  Prior to this , I worked as a software developer at Intel, Linz (now owned by Apple) while pursuing my my master's at <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>, Austria, with a major in Pervasive Computing. My education at JKU and work at Intel inspired me to venture into the field of data sciences.

 I also work as a researcher at <a href = "https://pro2future.at/about-us-de/"> Pro2Future, GmbH </a>, where my duties involve collaborating with industrial partners and help them find insights in their data.
