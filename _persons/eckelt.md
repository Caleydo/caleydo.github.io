<p>
  I'm a PhD student and research assistant in the Visual Data Science Group of the <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a>, Austria.
  My research focuses on interactive visualizations in the biomedical field. Together with my colleagues, I design and build data analysis tools to support domain experts.
  I received my master's and bachelor's degrees at <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/">Vienna University of Technology</a>, where I became interested in life sciences and the analysis of biomedical data.

  I'm teaching assistant for the Information Visualization, Visual Analytics, Explainable AI, and Computer Graphics courses at the Johannes Kepler University,
  and for the Visualisation module at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/">Imperial College Business School</a>.
