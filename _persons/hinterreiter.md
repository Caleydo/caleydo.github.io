I'm a PhD student and Project Assistant in the Visual Data Science Group.
My research focuses on time series visualization and dimensionality reduction in the context of explainable AI.
I am especially interested in non-linear embedding techniques.

My PhD is part of a collaboration with [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/).
In 2019 and 2020, I spent a year at the [Biomedical Image Analysis (BioMedIA) group](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at Imperial.

I received my Masters degree in Technical Physics at [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://www.jku.at/en/), working on the structural and chemical analysis of surfaces.
As I had grown increasingly interested in machine learning, visualization and graphic design, I decided to transition to visualization research for my PhD.
