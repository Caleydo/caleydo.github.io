I am a PhD Student and Project Assistant at the Visual Data Science group. 
Before that, I studied Computer Science at the Johannes Kepler University and finished the Masters Program with focus on Data Science in August 2020. 
In my Master Thesis, my research focused on Semantic Image Segmentation and Image Classification in the area of bark beetle detection.
