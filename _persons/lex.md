# About

I am a post-doctoral visualization researcher at the Visual Computing Group led by Hanspeter Pfister at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I received my PhD, Master's and Undergraduate degrees from the Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision at the Graz University of Technology where I studied under the supervision of Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg. In 2011 I was a visiting researcher at Prof. Peter Park's Computational Genomics Research Group at Harvard Medical School.
My primary research interests are interactive data visualization and analysis especially applied to molecular biology and pharmacology, and human computer interaction. My focus is my work on Caleydo, which is both, software that can be used by life science experts to visualize biomolecular data and pathways, but also a platform for implementing prototypes of radical visualization ideas.
I am particularly interested in subset visualization (think slice & dice) for heterogeneous datasets in a molecular biology context. A recent application example of this research is StratomeX, a Caleydo view for cancer subtype analysis.
My second major research topic is visualization related to biological networks (pathways). Examples are the Entourage and enRoute techniques which enable users to explore large quantities of experimental data in the context of multiple pathways.
On the more theoretic side I investigate how to visually express relationships between either visible or currently invisible items on the screen.
I am on the program committee for InfoVis and BioVis. For the latter I'm also poster co-chair. I review for a wide range of publications including IEEE TVCG, CG&A, and BMC Bioinformatics.
