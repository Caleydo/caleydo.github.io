<p>I am a tenured Full Professor at the <a href="http://www.cg.jku.at">Institute of Computer Graphics</a> at <a
    href="http://www.jku.at">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a> where I lead the JKU Visual Data Science Group.
I finished my PhD at the <a href="http://www.icg.tugraz.at">Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision</a>
at <a href="http://www.tugraz.at">Graz University of Technology</a> in early 2011 and moved to Linz later
that year.
In 2012 I was a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/">Department of Biomedical Informatics</a> (DBMI) at Harvard Medical School.
As part of a Fulbright scholarship for research and lecturing I was a visiting professor at the <a
    href="http://vcg.seas.harvard.edu">Visual Computing Group</a> at <a
    href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard Paulson School</a> in 2014.
I am also a guest lecturer at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school">Imperial College
    Business School</a>.</p>

<p>My scientific areas of interest include <b>visualization, visual analytics</b>, and <b>biological data
        visualization</b>, where I am particularly interested in the integrated analysis of large heterogeneous
    data. Together with my team I develop novel visual analysis tools for cancer research, drug discovery, and
    other biomedical applications. I am leading research projects funded by FWF, FFG and industrial partners.
    Parts of my research are embedded in the open-source project <a href="http://www.caleydo.org">Caleydo</a>,
    where I am one of the project leaders and founding-members. I am a PI or Co-PI in multiple research and
    industry projects and also a key researcher in the COMET K1-Centre <a
        href="http://pro2future.at">Pro2Future</a>. Since 2016 I am CEO of the JKU spin-off company <a
        href="http://datavisyn.io">datavisyn</a>.</p>

<p>I won Best Paper Awards at InfoVis'13, BioVis’12, InfoVis’11, GI’10 and Honorable Mention Awards at
    EuroVis'16, CHI'14, InfoVis'14 and EuroVis’12. I am a co-author of the Nature Methods <i>Points of View</i>
    column. In 2013 I co-edited the Special Issue on Visual Analytics in the IEEE Computer journal.
    Additionally, I actively contribute to the scientific community by serving on the organizing and program
    committee of several scientific events as well as by acting as a reviewer for high-quality journals and
    conferences. I was program chair of the <a href="http://www.visualdatascience.org/">IEEE Visualization in
        Data Science</a> symposium and papers and now general chair of <a href="http://biovis.net">BioVis</a>,
    the Symposium on Biological Data Visualization.</p>
