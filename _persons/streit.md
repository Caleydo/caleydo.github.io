<p>I am a tenured Full Professor at the <a href="http://www.cg.jku.at">Institute of Computer Graphics</a> at <a href="http://www.jku.at">Johannes Kepler University Linz</a> where I lead the JKU Visual Data Science Lab.
I finished my PhD at the <a href="http://www.icg.tugraz.at">Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision</a>
at <a href="http://www.tugraz.at">Graz University of Technology</a> in early 2011 and moved to Linz later
that year. In 2012 I was a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/">Department of Biomedical Informatics</a> (DBMI) at Harvard Medical School. As part of a Fulbright scholarship for research and lecturing I was a visiting professor at the <a href="http://vcg.seas.harvard.edu">Visual Computing Group</a> at <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard Paulson School</a> in 2014. I am also a guest lecturer at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school">Imperial College Business School</a>.</p>

<p>My scientific areas of interest include <b>visualization, visual analytics, and explainable AI</b>. Together with my team I develop novel visual analysis tools for cancer research, drug discovery, and other application areas. I am leading research projects funded by FWF, FFG, and industrial partners. I am a key researcher in the COMET K1-Centre <a href="http://pro2future.at">Pro2Future</a>. Since 2016 I am Co-Founder and CEO of the JKU spin-off company <a href="http://datavisyn.io">datavisyn</a> that develops visual analysis solutions for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>I won best paper and honorable mention awards at conferences including IEEE VIS and CHI. I was a co-author of the Nature Methods <i>Points of View</i> column. I actively contribute to the scientific community by serving on the organizing and program committee of several scientific events. I was general chair of the <a href="http://www.visualdatascience.org/">IEEE Visualization in Data Science</a> symposium and general chair of <a href="http://biovis.net">BioVis</a>, the Symposium on Biological Data Visualization.</p>
