I'm a PhD student and Project Assistant in the Visual Data Science Group.
My research focuses on interaction provenance using dimensionality reduction techniques and onboarding for interactive visualizations.


I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at [University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien](https://www.technikum-wien.at/studium/bachelor/biomedical_engineering/) and my Masters degree in Human-Centered Computing at the [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Campus Hagenberg](https://www.fh-ooe.at/campus-hagenberg/studiengaenge/master/human-centered-computing/), working on the identification of cognitive load with the physiological measurement technique heart-rate variability (HRV).
As I had grown increasingly interested in the perception of multidimensional visualization techniques, I decided to transition to visualization research for my PhD.

I am an external lecturer for <i>Management Reporting und Visual Analytics</i> at the
[University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Campus Steyr](https://www.fh-ooe.at/en/steyr-campus/studiengaenge/bachelor/accounting-controlling-and-financial-management/) at the Institut of Accounting, Controlling, and Financial Management.
