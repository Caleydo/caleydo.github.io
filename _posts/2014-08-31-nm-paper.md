Check out our latest <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/publications/2014_nm_stratomex/">paper</a> on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tools/stratomex/">StratomeX</a>, which was just published in Nature Methods. In this paper we describe how we integrated a sophisticated computational framework directly into the StratomeX visualization technique to enable rapid exploration of tens of thousands of stratifications in cancer genomics data, creating a unique and powerful tool for the identification and characterization of tumor subtypes. The tool can handle a wide range of genomic and clinical data types for cohorts with hundreds of patients. StratomeX also provides direct access to comprehensive data sets generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas <a href="http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/">Firehose analysis pipeline</a>.
