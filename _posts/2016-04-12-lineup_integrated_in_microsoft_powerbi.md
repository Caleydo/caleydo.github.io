Microsoft's PowerBI platform makes data visualization accessible to a broad audience. We're happy to see our LineUp tool [integrated into PowerBI](https://app.powerbi.com/visuals/show/TableSorter1450434005853) as "Table Sorter". It is exciting that one of our research prototypes has become part of a popular commercial product. See the [tools page](tools/lineup/) for details about LineUp.
