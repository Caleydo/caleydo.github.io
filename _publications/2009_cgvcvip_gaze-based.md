abstract: "
<p>As the complexity and amount of real world data continuously grows, modern visualization systems are changing. Traditional information visualization techniques are often not sufficient to allow an in-depth visual data exploration process. Multiple view systems combined with linking & brushing are only one building block of a successful InfoVis system. In this paper we propose the incorporation of cheap and simple gaze-based interaction. We employ the tracking information not for selecting data (i.e. mouse interaction) but for an intelligent adaption of 2D and 3D visualizations. Derived from the focus+context paradigm, we call this gaze-focus. The proposed methods are demonstrated by means of three different visualizations.</p>"
