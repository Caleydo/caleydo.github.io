abstract: "
<p>We present a visual data mining application using the combination of clinical data, pathways and biomolecular data. Using pathways to navigate and filter the clinical and molecular data allows a more systematic and efficient investigation of problems in modern life science. A multiplicity of hypotheses can be evaluated in the same period of time, enabling a much better exploitation of the data. We present a system for data preprocessing and automatic classification, a set of visualization views and finally the integration of the views in the Caleydo
   visualization framework, which enables the coupling of molecular and a broad spectrum of clinical data. With the help of the Caleydo framework the medical expert can identify connections between genetic parameters, patient subgroups, and drug responses in an intuitive way.</p>"
