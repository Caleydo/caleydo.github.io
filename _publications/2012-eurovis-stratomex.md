Abstract
Identification and characterization of cancer subtypes are important areas of research that are based on the
integrated analysis of multiple heterogeneous genomics datasets. Since there are no tools supporting this process,
much of this work is done using ad-hoc scripts and static plots, which is inefficient and limits visual exploration of
the data. To address this, we have developed StratomeX, an integrative visualization tool that allows investigators
to explore the relationships of candidate subtypes across multiple genomic data types such as gene expression,
DNA methylation, or copy number data. StratomeX represents datasets as columns and subtypes as bricks in these
columns. Ribbons between the columns connect bricks to show subtype relationships across datasets. Drill-down
features enable detailed exploration. StratomeX provides insights into the functional and clinical implications of
candidate subtypes by employing small multiples, which allow investigators to assess the effect of subtypes on
molecular pathways or outcomes such as patient survival. As the configuration of viewing parameters in such
a multi-dataset, multi-view scenario is complex, we propose a meta visualization and configuration interface
for dataset dependencies and data-view relationships. StratomeX is developed in close collaboration with domain
experts. We describe case studies that illustrate how investigators used the tool to explore subtypes in large datasets
and demonstrate how they efficiently replicated findings from the literature and gained new insights into the data.
