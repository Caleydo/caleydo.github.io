abstract: "Nowadays, manufacturers are increasingly able to
collect and analyze data from sensors on manufacturing equipment, and also from other types of machinery, such as smart
meters, pipelines, delivery trucks, etc. Nevertheless, many manufacturers are not yet ready to use analytics beyond a tool to track
historical performance. However, just knowing what happened
and why it happened does not use the full potential of the
data and is not sufficient anymore. Manufacturers need to know
what happens next and what actions to take in order to get
optimal results. It is a challenge to develop advanced analytics
techniques including machine learning and predictive algorithms
to transform data into relevant information for gaining useful
insights to take appropriate action. In the proposed research we
target new analytic methods and tools that make insights not only
more understandable but also actionable by decision makers.
The latter requires that the results of data analytics have an
immediate effect on the processes of the manufacturer. Thereby,
data analytics has the potential to improve industrial processes
by reducing maintenance costs, avoiding equipment failures and
improving business operations. Accordingly, the overall objective
of this project is to develop a set of tools — including algorithms,
analytic machinery, planning approaches and visualizations —
for industrial process improvements based on data analytics."
