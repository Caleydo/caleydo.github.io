abstract: "Guidance methods have the potential of bringing considerable benefits to Visual Analytics (VA), alleviating the burden on the
user and allowing a positive analysis outcome. However, the boundary between conventional VA approaches and guidance is not
sharply defined. As a consequence, framing existing guidance methods is complicated and the development of new approaches
is also compromised. In this paper, we try to bring these concepts in order, defining clearer boundaries between guidance and
no-guidance. We summarize our findings in form of a decision tree that allows scientists and designers to easily frame their
solutions. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our findings by applying our guideline to a set of published approaches.
