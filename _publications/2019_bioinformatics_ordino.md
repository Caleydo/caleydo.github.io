abstract: "
<p>Summary: Ordino is a web-based analysis tool for cancer genomics that allows users to flexibly
rank, filter and explore genes, cell lines and tissue samples based on pre-loaded data, including
The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and manually uploaded information.
Interactive tabular data visualization that facilitates the user-driven prioritization process forms a
core component of Ordino. Detail views of selected items complement the exploration. Findings
can be stored, shared and reproduced via the integrated session management.</p>"

# After the --- you can put information that you want to appear on the website using markdown formatting or HTML. A good example are acknowledgements, extra references, an erratum, etc.
