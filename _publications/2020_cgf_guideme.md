abstract: "Guidance is an emerging topic in the field of visual analytics. Guidance can support users in pursuing their analytical goals more
efficiently and help in making the analysis successful. However, it is not clear how guidance approaches should be designed and
what specific factors should be considered for effective support. In this paper, we approach this problem from the perspective of
guidance designers. We present a framework comprising requirements and a set of specific phases designers should go through
when designing guidance for visual analytics. We relate this process with a set of quality criteria we aim to support with our
framework, that are necessary for obtaining a suitable and effective guidance solution. To demonstrate the practical usability
of our methodology, we apply our framework to the design of guidance in three analysis scenarios and a design walk-through
session. Moreover, we list the emerging challenges and report how the framework can be used to design guidance solutions that
mitigate these issues."
