abstract: "The fight against the ”eight-toothed spruce bark beetle” (Ips Typographus) is a crucial task in forest management. Since the conditions for spruce bark beetles are becoming better due to climate
change and monocultural farming, it is necessary to develop more efficient techniques to fight their spreading.
There is some recent research in the area of bark beetle or dead wood
detection, however, all of the projects have slightly different goals and
experiments with different approaches. Using recent research from
semantic image segmentation and image classification with methods
from deep learning, a novel approach to detect and identify infestation
of spruce trees by the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle was developed
in this thesis.
More concretely, this thesis covers the localization of sick spruce trees
from a bird eye’s perspective and the identification of infested spruce
trees directly from the trunk, with the help of RGB images taken by
drone and smartphone cameras.
The development of a mobile application allows users to perform inference in real-time and therefore leads to a more efficient and fast
removal of infested trees.
With only 35 annotated images available for the segmentation task
and 80 annotated images for the image classification task, it was necessary to use techniques like transfer learning or data augmentation
to artificially enlarge the dataset.
The solutions presented in this project and the suggestions for future
work should guide further research in this area and could be viewed
as an advanced baseline for such work."
