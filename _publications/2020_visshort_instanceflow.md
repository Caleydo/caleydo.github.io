abstract: "Classification is one of the most important supervised machine learning tasks. During the training of a classification model, the training instances are fed to the model multiple times (during multiple
epochs) in order to iteratively increase the classification performance.
The increasing complexity of models has led to a growing demand
for model interpretabilty through visualizations. Existing approaches
mostly focus on the visual analysis of the final model performance
after training and are often limited to aggregate performance measures. In this paper we introduce InstanceFlow, a novel dual-view
visualization tool that allows users to analyze the learning behavior
of classifiers over time on the instance-level. A Sankey diagram
visualizes the flow of instances throughout epochs, with on-demand
detailed glyphs and traces for individual instances. A tabular view
allows users to locate interesting instances by ranking and filtering. In this way, InstanceFlow bridges the gap between class-level
and instance-level performance evaluation while enabling users to
perform a full temporal analysis of the training process.
