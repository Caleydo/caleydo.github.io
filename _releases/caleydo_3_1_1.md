Caleydo 3.1.1 is released, the first stable release of the 3.1 series, and with it comes a completely revamped pathway analysis module - Caleydo Entourage. Here is a little preview:

Caleydo Entourage
Entourage combines multi-pathway analysis with the experimental data analysis features of enRoute in a sophisticated interface. To get an impression of the capabilities of Entourage check out the brand-new Pathway Analysis Help Pages.

Major new features for pathway analysis include:

* Multi-pathway analysis using the contextual subset paradigm. Easily discover cross-connections between pathways, find related pathways, etc.
Deep integration of experimental data analysis with pathway analysis - you can explore all your genetic, drug, or clinical data through one sophisticated interface.
Completely new and convenient data assignment interface lets you choose multiple datasets, stratifications and groups to visualize in enRoute.
Other components of Caleydo have also undergone major improvements. The highlights:
* Added data pre-processing methods to choose from, including z-standardization of datasets, clipping based on standard-deviations, etc.
Box plots are now available in StratomeX and in enRoute making analysis of distributions easier than ever.
Improved data export - cluster assignments are now included.
Integration of StratomeX and Entourage - pathways viewed in StratomeX can now easily be explored in Entourage.
Significantly extended and improved documentation.
