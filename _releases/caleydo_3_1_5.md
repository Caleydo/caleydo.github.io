Caleydo 3.1.5 introduces statistical analysis for experimental data to the pathway analysis tools. You can now test whether a pattern you see is also statistically significant. We provide two tests: Fisher's exact test and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, to account for different situations. Using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test you can also automatically discover significant partitions considering adjusted p-values to account for the false discovery rate.

In addition this release fixes two bugs:

 * Fixing problems on Max OS X preventing execution.
 * Fixing problems with Debian packages on Linux.
