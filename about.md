I am a Research Associate in the Park Lab at the Center for Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School and an Associated Researcher in the Cancer Program at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where Iâ€™m involved in the analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. I received my PhD from the University of Cambridge and was a predoctoral fellow at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).

My long-term goal is to develop computational tools that enable data-driven biomedical research, with a focus on visualization and exploration of genomics and epigenomics data. Currently, I am researching and developing novel tools to visualize heterogeneous data from large-scale cancer genomics studies, integration of visual and computational approaches to support sense-making in biology, and software to support reproducible research in epigenomics and genomics. My research is funded by an NIH/NHGRI K99/R00 Pathway to Independence fellowship.

I am a co-founder and former General Chair of BioVis, the IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization, and co-founder of VIZBI, the annual Workshop on Visualizing Biological Data. In the past, I served in various leadership roles in the ISCB Student Council of the International Society for Computational Biology and on the Board of Directors of the ISCB. Occasionally, I contribute to the Points of View data visualization column in Nature Methods.
