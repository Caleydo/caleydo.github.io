Caleydo Web is a platform for developing web-based visualization applications. Caleydo provides sophisticated infrastructure for **managing data**, **syncrhonizing views**, **tracking history**, etc. Caleydo Web comes in two flavors: 

 * a lightweight client library
 * a full client-server system
 

In Caleydo Web, all components are [plugins](plugin_mechanism). The client is realized in TypeScript and JavaScript using HTML5, while the server is implemented in Python and uses the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. Client and server communicate via REST and Websocket interfaces. 

This documentation has two components: [Tutorials](tutorials), where we demonstrate how to build increasingly complex applications using a mix of all components, and the [Reference](reference), where we explain the core components in detail.
