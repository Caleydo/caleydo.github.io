Caleydo Web is a platform for developing web-based visualization applications. Caleydo provides sophisticated infrastructure for **managing data**, **syncrhonizing views**, **tracking history**, etc. Caleydo Web comes in two flavors: 

 * a lightweight client library
 * a full client-server system
 
# Architecture

In Caleydo Web, all components are [plugins](plugin_mechanism). The client is realized in TypeScript and JavaScript using HTML5, while the server is implemented in Python and uses the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. Client and server communicate via REST and Websocket interfaces. 

This documentation has two components: [Tutorials](tutorials), where we demonstrate how to build increasingly complex applications using a mix of all components, and the [Reference](reference), where we explain the core components in detail. 

# TODO:

 * What is it for?
 * Why to use it and why not something else?
 * What is the philosophy behind our design?
 * What design patterns are used to implement it?
 * What is the overall (high-level) architecture?
 * How to get involved?
 * What does it help me to do? (Features)
 * Why should I use calweb ? (and maybe not X or Y)
 * How complicated is it? (Jumpstart example)
