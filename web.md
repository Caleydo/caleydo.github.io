# Creating an App

To create an app add a new folder that follows a specific structure to the plugin directory. 

What do the files in the app do:

  * index.html - standard html
  * main.js - this is where your custom javascript goes 
  * data - put data in this directory, define the data format via json in 
     * index.json defines the data
     * other files - contain the data
    
  * style.scss - contains your styles
